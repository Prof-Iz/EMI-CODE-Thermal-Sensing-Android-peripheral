# EMI CODE Thermal Sensing Android peripheral
 Code repository for EMI Project May Sem Y2 Engineering<br>

Repository contains 2 folders
<ol>Android Code</ol>
<ol>Arduino Code</ol>

## Arduino Code
The project in question requires the Arduino to take in data from 2 sensor modules - a thermal sensing module and an ultrasound distance measuring module. Code would collect the data and then process it before passing data through connected serial to an accompanyng Android device <br>

## Andorid Code
